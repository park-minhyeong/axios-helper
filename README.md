# AXIOS Wizard
While working on client-server integration and external API integration, I started to feel the limitations of fetch. Axios offered a variety of config options, making it convenient, but setting it up for each project became tedious. To solve this issue, I created axios-wizard and published it on npm.

After finishing it, this thought came to mind:

`axios is under-controlled`

## HOW TO USE
First, create an object that defines the origin of the API server. The key is the serverâ€™s name, and the value is its address. 

After that, call the handler function to declare the API controller.

```typescript
import { handler } from "axios-wizard";

const apiConfig: Record<string, string>={
	some: 'https://api.some.com'
	some2: import.meta.env.SOME2_API_ORIGIN
	...
}

const httpRequest = handler(apiConfig)
```

It is possible to write the API call function as follows.
```typescript
// api.ts
const apiUndefined = httpRequest.some() // end-point is https://api.some.com
const apiV1 = httpRequest.some("v1") // end-point is https://api.some.com/v1

async function getTest(){
	const response = await apiV1.get("/test") // end-point is https://api.some.com/v1/test, and can generic
	return response.data; // return type is AxiosConfig
}

interface Test{
	a: string
}

async function getTestWithGeneric(){
	const response = await apiV1.get<Test>("/test") // can empower generic type
	return response.data; // return type is AxiosConfig
}

```
